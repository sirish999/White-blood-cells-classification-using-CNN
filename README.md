# White-blood-cells-classification-using-CNN
Accurate classification of white blood cells is critical for diagnosing blood-based disorders. Traditional methods of classifying white blood cells require experts or expensive machinery. Recent advancements in image classification have made deep learning a viable option for this task.   In this project, we explored three different approaches for developing an accurate model. Using a small-scale dataset of only 365 images and heavy use of image augmentation, dropout, and other regularization techniques, our best convolutional layer-based model was able to reach a testing accuracy of 94.3%.
